        <h1>The League of Ireland needs your help!!</h1>
        <section id="mainIndexLeft">
            <h2>What's going on with the League?!!</h2>
            <p>The league of ireland is in a very good position right now with the league season over it has recorded its largest attendences in history with
            over one million people attending or viewing LOI games accross the divisions (Premier, First, FAI cup, WFAI cup, and WPremier) this year and with
            shamrock rovers going on a major run in the conference league (Unbeaten in the league phase as of 02/12/2024) the league looks in a very good position
            to capitilise on the growing interest and standered, However it is crucial that now plans are put in place to make sure the league and irish football
            as a whole benefits from this. And that is where the proposed third division enters the field. As of last year the irish premier division became
            fully profsionalised with the last part-time club <a href="https://droghedaunited.ie">Drogheda United</a> becoming fully profesional after its purchase by the trivella group
            and with full time clubs such as <a href="https://www.corkcityfc.ie">Cork City</a> this season and the relegated <a href="https://www.dundalkfc.com">Dundalk FC</a> in the coming season fully
            professional clubs are begining to enter the first division of Irish football. this is a good thing to see as it will increase the competitiveness
            of clubs competing in the leagues. However it would also mean that the first division could become more lobsided when new clubs are added take 
            for example <a href="https://kerryfc.com">Kerry FC</a> who since their welcome introduction to the league in 2022 have finished dead last in 10th place
            for both season in a row. The introduction of a third division of irish football could solve these issues as more</p>

            <p>Great news for irish football as representitives from the FAI general assembley voted to introduce the Aligned Football Calander for Ireland. What this would mean for irish football is that all the regional
            leagues such as the LSL (Leinster Senior League) and MSL (Munster Senior League) will change their league season and fixtures to run in conjunction with the league of ireland as Ireland is a summer league while
            other leagues in ireland run as standered, this will lead to better condition of pitches across ireland and with league timetables inline will hopefully lead to a proper footballing pyramid in
            ireland. This Meeting is the first step in a proposed 11 point pathways plan for irish football and is a great sign of change for footballing in ireland if you would like to learn more you can find the original article
