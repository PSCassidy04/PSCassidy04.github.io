        <p>The league of ireland is a football league that currently consists of 2 divisions the preier division and first division. Each division consists of 10
        teams that face each other 4 times twice away and twice at home to consist of 36 games total for a season that lasts from feburary to november.
        The current champions of 2024 are Shelbourne FC while Cork City won the first Division. The premier division of ireland is considered the 32nd best league in
        europe opening ireland to a europa league spot for one of its 4 european positions. Currently the teams in the loi are mostly from dublin but other counties
        do have representation and as more teams apply to join such as Mayo FC and CK United more counties shalll begin to be represented within the league.
        With Shamrock Rovers currently playing in european competition the coefficent of the league can still move and should shamrock rovers beat chelsea FC
        during their campaign the coeficient would move up another spot.
