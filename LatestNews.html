            <p>Its Finally Happening. On the 12th of December 2024 the FAi have announced the creation of the national League of Ireland. The New national league
            will stand as the third tier in the irish football pyramid and will act as a connecting point between the LOI and grassroots of irish football
            the League format will consist of 20 teams seperated into a north and south league of 10 teams each. This new league is set to begin in 2027 after the
            shorter league that is to follow from 2026 due to the aligned calander program that was passed earlier. Althought the 20 teams that will be entered are unknown
            they can begin the process to aply now and must do so before feburary 2025 in order to ensure their place. Thi is incredinle new as for years irish football fans
            have been crying out for a new division and after many years and passed deadlines or delays we can now go forward knowing that irish football is begining to
            go further in a positive direction.

            <p>Great news for irish football as representitives from the FAI general assembley voted to introduce the Aligned Football Calander for Ireland. What this would mean for irish football is that all the regional
            leagues such as the LSL (Leinster Senior League) and MSL (Munster Senior League) will change their league season and fixtures to run in conjunction with the league of ireland as Ireland is a summer league while
            other leagues in ireland run as standered, this will lead to better condition of pitches across ireland and with league timetables inline will hopefully lead to a proper footballing pyramid in
            ireland. This Meeting is the first step in a proposed 11 point pathways plan for irish football and is a great sign of change for footballing in ireland if you would like to learn more you can find the original article
